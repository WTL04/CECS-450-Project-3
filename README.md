# CECS 450 – Project 3: AOI Pattern Analysis & Scan Behavior Visualization (Team 7)

This repository contains a complete analysis and visualization toolkit for exploring **eye-tracking data**, **AOI (Area-of-Interest) patterns**, **saccades**, and **scan-efficiency metrics**.  
It combines data preprocessing, pattern extraction, proportional frequency analysis, transition metrics, and multiple interactive visualizations built in Python.
